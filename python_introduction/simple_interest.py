# Defining the investment parameters
principal = 1000  # The principal amount in dollars
rate = 0.05       # The annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # Time in years

# Calculating a simple interest using the formula I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Printing the final result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
